# myBreak
Fitbit App for when you NEED a break :p

Lunch is never enough. After nearly 4 hours of pretending to write code and copying from StackOverflow every weekday, 30 minutes just ain't it, chief. I needed a way to extend my lunch break - but WITHOUT my boss finding out.

myBreak implements a unique functionality, bending the laws of time and space to give you 45 minutes of break from 1:00pm to 1:30. Then, quick as lightning, it catches back up by 2:00pm, and no one's the wiser.
During the time warp, users simply tap to check the actual time (in case, of course, an emergency were to happen).

This project was developed for HackTCNJ 2019.
